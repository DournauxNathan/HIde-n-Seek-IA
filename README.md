# Unity3D Hide and Seek Game

Welcome to the Unity3D Hide and Seek Game repository! This project serves as the foundation for an exciting Hide and Seek game in Unity, featuring AI-controlled characters with hiding and seeking capabilities. I just wanted to experimente Unity AI so here this mini-game or more like demo.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for an engaging Hide and Seek game. It includes an AI-controlled character with both hiding and seeking capabilities. The AI's behavior is divided into roles of Hider and Seeker, and it features field of view (FOV) detection, movement, interaction with objects, and advanced game mechanics. This repository serves as a solid foundation for creating an exciting Hide and Seek gaming experience in Unity (I hope).

### Key Components
- AI Controller: Handles AI behavior, including movement, detection, and decision-making.
- Field of View (FOV): Defines the AI's visual perception with a cone-shaped FOV.

## Features

- **Hiding and Seeking:** The AI can take on two roles: Hider and Seeker. Customize AI behaviors for each role.
- **Field of View:** The AI has a defined field of view, and the FOV can be visualized in the Unity editor.
- **Navigation:** Utilize the Unity NavMeshAgent for realistic AI movement and pathfinding.
